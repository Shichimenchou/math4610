A field I was surprised to find increasingly cares about machine precision is agriculture. At the link below I
read about a new style of crop management that relies on precise GPS data. In essence, a farm vehicle is equipped
with a computer, a GPS unit, and a scanning device. Its position is tracked via satellite then corrected on the
computer for precise accuracy. This allows the vehicle to scan for chemical information from the soil using the
scanner and map that to precise location data, allowing the vehicle to adjust how much fertilizer, pesticide,
and seed it uses in each spot for maximum yield.
